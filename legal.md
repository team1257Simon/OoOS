## Newlib (lib/newlib/**):
    See "COPYING" under lib/newlib. The comments at the top of the files were removed by the preprocessor during the initial import; the stripped files are only being used during development until the full build via libtool produces a usable library (which should be once the OS reaches a certain level of compliance with POSIX)
